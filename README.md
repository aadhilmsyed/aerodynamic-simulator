# Aerodynamic Flap Configuration Simulator
### PHYS 1A Honors Project
### Aadhil Mubarak Syed

An interactive aerodynamic simulation tool that visualizes airflow patterns and thermal distributions around different aircraft flap configurations. This project demonstrates the physics of flight and how various flap designs affect aerodynamic performance.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of 10 different flap configurations:
  - Plain Flap
  - Split Flap
  - Slotted Flap
  - Fowler Flap
  - Double-Slotted Flap
  - Triple-Slotted Flap
  - Krueger Flap
  - Leading-Edge Slat
  - Zap Flap
  - Gouge Flap

- Real-time visualization features:
  - Dynamic airflow patterns
  - Temperature distribution (color-coded)
  - Pressure visualization
  - Adjustable airspeed (0-500 knots)
  - Interactive flap animation
